Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, iOS, and Android in 2020, and on PlayStation 5 in 2021, and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded on a regular basis through patches using the games as a service model.
Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.
Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and immersive open world, but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a revenue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022.
